# Disaster-Response-Pipeline
## Project Description
Disaster Response Pipeline is the part of Udacity Nanodegree. In this project, we are going to build a model to classify messages that are sent during disasters. There are few pre-defined categories, and examples of these categories include military, Medical help, Search And Rescue, flood, food etc. During any disaster we face problem to filter the message as there are millions of messages floating through social media or through disaster organizations.By classifying these messages, we can allow these messages to be sent to the appropriate disaster relief agency on priority basis. This project involves the building of a basic ETL and Machine Learning pipeline to facilitate the task. This is also a multi-label classification task, since a message can belong to one or more categories. We will be working with a data set provided by Figure Eight containing real messages that were sent during disaster events.

Finally, this project contains a web app where you can input a message and get classification results.
